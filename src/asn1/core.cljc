  "X.690 DER, portable `.cljc`.

  ## Why DER and not BER, stated as a rule rather than an omission

  Every structure this library exists to serve — CMS SignedData, an X.509
  certificate, an RFC 3161 timestamp token — is **signed**. A signature is over
  bytes, so a parser that accepts a value it cannot re-encode identically is not
  a lenient parser; it is a parser that will report a valid signature over
  something the sender did not sign, or a broken one over something they did.

  So the BER forms DER forbids are **rejected** rather than tolerated:

  | rejected | why it matters |
  |---|---|
  | indefinite length (`0x80` … `00 00`) | length is not in the bytes, so two readers can disagree about where the element ends |
  | non-minimal long-form length | `81 05` and `05` mean the same length and hash differently |
  | non-minimal INTEGER (leading `00` / `FF`) | two encodings of the same number |
  | constructed OCTET STRING / BIT STRING | the content is a concatenation, so the same octets have many encodings |
  | trailing bytes after the outermost element | the thing that was hashed is not the thing that was parsed |

  `decode` therefore either returns a structure whose `encode` reproduces the
  input byte-for-byte, or throws. `der-round-trips?` asserts exactly that and is
  what the tests hold every fixture to.

  ## Every element keeps its own bytes

  `:asn1/der` is the complete TLV of that element and `:asn1/content` is its
  content octets, both retained on parse. This is not a convenience: CMS hashes
  the DER of `eContent` and of `signedAttrs` **re-tagged from `[0] IMPLICIT` to
  `SET`**, and PAdES needs the byte offsets of a signature placeholder inside a
  document it must not otherwise touch. Recomputing those from a parsed tree
  would mean re-encoding, and re-encoding is the thing that must not be in the
  trust path.

  ## Bytes

  Functions accept anything byte-like — a `byte[]`, a `Uint8Array`, or a seq of
  0–255 ints — following `io-multiformats`. Internally everything is a vector of
  unsigned ints, which behaves identically on both platforms; `encode` returns
  platform-native bytes and `encode-ints` returns the vector.

  No clock, no network, no keys. Time values are parsed to strings and never to
  an instant, because `UTCTime`'s two-digit year needs a sliding window whose
  answer depends on when you ask."
